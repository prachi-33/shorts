## 🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional video editing is:
- ⏱️ **Time-intensive**: 1 hour of raw footage requires 5-8 hours of editing
- 💰 **Expensive**: Professional editors charge $50-150/hour
- 🎓 **Skill-dependent**: Requires expertise in editing software
- 🚫 **Non-scalable**: Manual editing doesn't scale with content volume
